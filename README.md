Hello, im Paul and I own a company while being 19 years old.

I have experience in many things like: <br>
~60h Graphic Design (Canva, PlaceIt, Publisher, Gimp, Krita...) includes a 6 week internship <br>
~30h Video editing (DaVinci Resolve, CapCut) <br>
~20h 3d Design (Blender) <br>
~10h Web designing (html, css, a little bit js) <br>

As you can see I have nothing that I am really experienced at, so thats why, 
starting from today the 26th August, im going to socially isolate myself because I want to see what I can achieve if I not only try but do my best.
I couldn't really find another way to change myself i do have a healthy routine but im not getting enough work done.

Also i love doing Calisthenics in my free time and my gym split is:
upper body, rest day, lower body, rest day and repeat.
